I have investigated data of below questions via Tableau;

What are the total numbers of subscribers in each subject?
How does the average content duration/price/number of students vary across different subjects?
How many courses are free and paid for each subject?
What is the average price of web development courses at different levels?
What are the 20 most popular courses? Also, include the following information:
- Their level
- Whether they are free or paid
- Whether any are free beginner courses,
- and the duration of the courses.
Does content duration impact the price of the course?
